## Week 4 Activity:

- complete the `MyStack` class to be a generic class that can store any type of data. Use the Main class to test the `MyStack` class.

- complete the `HelpDesk` that simulates a help desk system. The `HelpDesk` class should have a `Queue` that stores the help desk requests. The `HelpDesk` class can have a method `addRequest` that adds a request to the queue and a method `processRequest` that processes the request at the front of the queue. The `HelpDesk` class can also have a method `printRequests` that prints all the requests in the queue.

- PostFix is for extra credit. It is a simple calculator that uses a stack to evaluate postfix expressions.
