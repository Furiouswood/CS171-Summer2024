## Week 1 Activity:

- implement Course class which has courseName, courseCode, courseCredit

- implement Student class which has studentName, studentId, studentDepartment

- implement Teacher class which has teacherName, teacherId, teacherDepartment

- implement Department class which has departmentName, departmentCode

- implement University class which has universityName, universityLocation

- implement main class which has main method to test the above classes in each of the classes. In other words, create object of course, student, teacher, department, university and print the information of each object.

- make a reasonable use of the objects in the main method of the PracticeNow.java file. A reasonable use is to show that you understand how to create objects of the classes and how to use the objects to access the instance variables and methods of the classes, etc. (you already have an example of this in the [PracticeNow.java](Lab_1/activity/PracticeNow.java) file).

## Submission:

We use standard GitHub for this lab to submit the assignment. You need to create a repository named `CS171-Summer2024` and push your code to Lab_1 folder in the repository. Make sure to add me [amirih](https://github.com/amirih) as a collaborator to the repository and make the repository **private**.

For your repository, you need to have a README.md file that includes the following information:
Your name and your emory email address

Do not upload the files to Github, just push the code to the repository.
