## Week 2 Activity:

- implement another vehicle as a Java class and extend the [Lab_2/inheritance2/Vehicle.java](Lab_2/inheritance2/Vehicle.java) class. We have already implemented Car and Airplane classes for you. You can use them as a reference. You can choose any vehicle you like, for example, a bicycle, a boat, a train, etc.

Since the purpose of this activity is to help you in understanding the concepts and design the classes, you can add any additional methods, fields to make it more useful to implement the classes. You can also add additional classes if needed.
