/**
 * A class that represents a card player.
 * 
 * For each card player instance, we should keep track of how many points 
 * they earned in the game so far, as well as whether it is their turn or not.
 * Additionally, their hand and bank of cards should be stored in two 
 * separate ArrayLists of Card objects. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * A player's points, turn, and hand of cards should all be declared
 * private fields, whereas the bank of cards should be public, as follows: 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * 		private int points; 
 * 
 * 		private boolean turn; 
 * 
 * 		private ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; hand = new ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;(); 
 *
 * 		public ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; bank = new ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;();
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Note that the Field Summary section below will only show you public fields, 
 * but you must declare all the fields described above in your implementation of this class,
 * including the private fields. You are free to create additional fields if deemed necessary.
 * 
 * @param <Card> the type of card used in the game
